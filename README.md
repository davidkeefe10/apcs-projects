# apcs-projects
### A collection of Java projects I've created in AP Computer Science.

These programs showcase the Java principles I have learned in AP Computer Science A this year,
including Object-Oriented Programming, recursion, image integration, boolean expressions, and
iteration. This course will cover the basic of Java, addressing additional topics such as arrays, 
more in-depth graphics, searching and sorting, and algorithms. I will continue to update this 
repository throughout the year.
