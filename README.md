# apcs-projects
### A collection of Java projects I've created in AP Computer Science.

These programs showcase the Java principles I have learned in AP Computer Science A this year,
including Object-Oriented Programming, recursion, basic graphics and image integration, boolean expressions, and
iteration. This course will cover the basics of Java, addressing additional topics such as arrays, 
more in-depth graphics, searching and sorting, and algorithms. This is my first significant experience
with programming, and I have already learned an incredible amount. Beyond the Java skills listed above,
I have familiarized myself with Git and Github, command line operations, and Dropbox. I will continue to 
update this repository throughout the year.
